# Advanced TypeScript Learning Guide

This project focuses on mastering advanced TypeScript features through a structured step-by-step approach.

---

## Step 1: Deep Dive into Type System
- **Generics**  
  - Create generic functions, interfaces, and classes.  
  - Understand bounded generics (`extends`) and constraints.

- **Mapped Types**  
  - Utilize `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Record`, and create custom mapped types.

- **Utility Types**  
  - Explore `Pick`, `Omit`, `Exclude`, `Extract`, `NonNullable`, and `ReturnType`.

---

## Step 2: Advanced Types and Manipulations
- **Intersection and Union Types**  
  - Master complex type combinations and their use cases.

- **Conditional Types**  
  - Write conditional logic with types using `T extends U ? X : Y`.

- **Template Literal Types**  
  - Dynamically build types using string literals.

- **Distributive Conditional Types**  
  - Understand how conditional types distribute over unions.

---

## Step 3: Type Safety Enhancements
- **Type Guards**  
  - Write custom type guard functions using the `is` keyword.

- **Discriminated Unions**  
  - Simplify handling of multiple cases in unions with tagged unions.

- **Type Assertions and Casting**  
  - Learn when and how to use `as` and `<>`.

---

## Step 4: Advanced Features for Real-World Development
- **Declaration Merging**  
  - Extend existing interfaces or modules.

- **Decorators (Experimental)**  
  - Explore class and property decorators for meta-programming.

- **Namespaces and Modules**  
  - Understand when to use namespaces versus modules.

---

## Step 5: Type-Driven Development
- **Conditional Compilation**  
  - Utilize `keyof`, `typeof`, and `infer` to extract and manipulate types.

- **Polymorphic Types**  
  - Use `this` types in classes and methods for chaining and polymorphism.

- **Variadic Tuple Types**  
  - Work with tuples of arbitrary lengths and infer relationships.

---

## Step 6: Codebase-Level Concepts
- **Strict Mode Options**  
  - Enable strict type-checking with `strict`, `noImplicitAny`, and `strictNullChecks`.

- **Custom Type Definitions**  
  - Write `.d.ts` files for third-party libraries or APIs.

- **Project References**  
  - Optimize large projects by using TypeScript project references.

---

## How to Use This Guide
1. Start with **Step 1** and progress sequentially.  
2. Practice examples for each concept in your TypeScript environment.  
3. Build real-world projects to apply these concepts.

Happy learning!
